# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending at supermarkets using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand and target different customer groups more effectively, enabling tailored marketing strategies and personalized offerings.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial technique in marketing that allows businesses to divide their customers into distinct groups. By clustering customers based on their income and spending patterns, supermarkets can better understand their customers and design specific marketing strategies for each segment. This project demonstrates how to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to achieve this.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

- **scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Results
The final output of this project is a visualization of customer segments based on their income and spending scores. These segments can be used by supermarkets to better target their customers with specific products and offers.
